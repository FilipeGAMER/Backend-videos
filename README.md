## Tecnologies Explanation

- **fastify**: I learned about It during the Node.js Services Development (LFW212) course and liked the way It works

- **MongoDB Atlas**: Primarily because I wanted to use a free online DB and I has already used It on a previous course

- **Mongoose**: Fastify has a lot of opitions that take a lot of things from your hand, but I decided to used mongoose to learn how It works and to not rely on things made for fastify.

- **jsonwebtoken**: Decided to use it has a way to autorize users after a login and to learn how It works.

- **TESTS**: I decided to use TAP, and I had to use mongodb-memory-server, this way the tests won't stop if the DB is offline

  - `GET /videos/:id` - return the video if the *id* is valid, if not, return *Not Found*
  - `POST /videos` - create the video if all fields are filled and valid, return a json with the new video information
  - `PUT /videos/:id` - update 1 or more fields of a video, return a json with the updated video information
  - `DELETE /videos/:id` - delete a video, return a message if success or error

  - `PUT /categories/:id` - update 1 or more fields of a category, return a json with the updated category information
  - `DELETE /categories/:id` - delete a category, return a message if success or error
- Create a relationship between video and category, assigning a category for each video
- Create a route `GET /categories/:id/videos` to return all videos with the informed category
- Create a route `GET /videos/?search=title` using query parameters to return videos with the search in the title
- Enable pagination on every `GET` route, limiting the return of 5 itens per page.
